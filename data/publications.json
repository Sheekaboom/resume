		"abstract": "MATLAB is a good testbed for prototyping new FDTD techniques as it provides quick programming, debugging and visualization capabilities compared to lower level languages such as C or FORTRAN. However, the major disadvantage of using MATLAB is its slow execution. For faster simulations, one should use other programming languages like Fortran or C with CUDA when utilizing graphics processing units. Development of simulation codes using these other programming languages is not as easy as when using MATLAB. Thus the main objective of this paper is to investigate ways to increase the throughput of a fully functional finite difference time domain method coded in MATLAB to be able to simulate practical problems with visualization capabilities in reasonable time. We present simple ways to improve the efficiency of MATLAB simulations using the parallel toolbox along with the multi-core central processing units (CPUs) or the multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). Native and simple MATLAB constructs with no external dependencies or libraries and no expensive or complicated hardware acceleration units are used in the present development.",

The approach first uses a vector network analyzer to characterize a three-dimensional test environment at RF. The vector network analyzer is then power- and phase-calibrated for the characterization of up-converting and down-converting phased arrays with an IF input or output. We illustrate the approach with measurements of a down-converting phased array.",

Tests will be run in both languages to compare both CPU and GPU computations. The runtimes of a variety of problems using each of these platforms will also be compared for a variety of mathematical operations typically used in electromagnetic problems.

This paper studies how both languages compare in throughput for a variety of tasks when utilizing complex numbers which are common in electromagnetics applications. The compared tasks include basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with more complex operations like exponentiation, summation, Fourier transforms, and matrix solving. Each of these tests is performed for both single and double precision on the CPU. A 2D finite difference frequency domain problem and a planar array beamforming problem are also presented for comparison throughput for realistic simulations.",

		"abstract": "Next-generation wireless communications utilize millimeter-wave frequencies and greater bandwidths alongside large-scale phased array architectures. These additions to precursor wireless communications introduce new factors and uncertainties due to hardware non-idealities that can affect data transmission and communication functions, such as channel estimators, reducing the system performance. To ensure optimal performance, evaluation of the channel estimators requires capturing the effects of hardware non-idealities in varying phased array architectures and propagation channels. We have developed a channel estimator evaluator framework to provide a performance evaluation of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based channel estimators. This evaluator provides testing of millimeter-wave phased array architectures with realistic phased array hardware components and uncertainties. The evaluator generates performance metrics to help optimize estimators for various array architectures and propagation channels without the need for time- and cost-intensive measurement campaigns.",
