    "objective":"I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering, interested in high performance computing for simulation and modeling, communications systems, and electromagnetic design and test. My PhD research focuses on the simulation of next generation communications systems and the usage of Monte Carlo methods to augment channel estimation in these systems. Alongside working on my PhD, I am currently working on developing wireless communication measurement systems at the National Institute of Standards of Technology (NIST)."
